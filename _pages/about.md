Iâ€™m interested in the ways both the human brain and language models learn and understand language. I focus on bilingual processing, particularly in syntactic processing in second language learners, and comparisons between multilingual large language models and bilingual brains. I'm currently a second year PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles in the [BlankLangLab](https://www.blanklanglab.com/).
  
I received my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was an R.A. in the [UIUC Electrophysiology and Language Processing Lab](UIUC%20Electrophysiology%20and%20Language%20Processing%20Lab). After graduating, I spent two years as an Research Assistant at the [Neuroscience of Language Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/nellab/) of New York University Abu Dhabi.
