I’m interested widely in the ways both the human brain and computational language models use and understand language. I have a special interest in bilingual processing, grammatical and human gender in language, and semitic languages, and have utilized M/EEG and traditional psycholinguistic methodologies to investigate these topics. I’m applying to PhD programs in both linguistics and cognitive science programs during the 2022-2023 cycle, where I’m hoping to continue research into language processing from both an neruoscientific and computational perspective.
  

I received my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was an R.A. in the [UIUC Electrophysiology and Language Processing Lab](UIUC%20Electrophysiology%20and%20Language%20Processing%20Lab). During my undergraduate degree, I received the FLAS fellowship for Arabic language study. I’m currently an RA under Alec Marantz at the [Neuroscience of Language Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/nellab/) of New York University Abu Dhabi.
